To avoid this issue, make sure all classes used with `@apply` are correctly defined in your Tailwind configuration or that you have added them as custom classes.   You might add a custom build process or linting step to check that all classes used in `@apply` exist.  One approach is to generate a list of all defined classes from your Tailwind config and compare it against those used in `@apply` statements.

Here's how you could implement a simple check within the `bugSolution.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Tailwind CSS @apply Fix</title>
  <link href="../dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-100">
  <p class="text-green-500">This text is green because the class exists</p>
  <p>This text is styled by an @apply directive checking for the class existance</p>
</body>
</html>
```
