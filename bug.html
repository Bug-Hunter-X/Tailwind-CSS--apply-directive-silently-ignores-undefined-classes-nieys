This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  It might not throw an immediate error, but it will result in the styles not being applied as expected.  This can be frustrating because it doesn't show up as a clear compilation error, leading to hard-to-find styling issues.
